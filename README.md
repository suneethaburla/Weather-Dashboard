# Day-Planner

## Project Title: Day-Planner
## Project Description
This project describes how to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Jquery code.

## Play proceeds as follows:

* The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:

* The time
* A field to hold user input
* A save button

* Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.
* Near the top of the calendar, the application displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.
